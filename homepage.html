            <h2>Light Bulbs</h2>
            <p>Light bulbs are essential for providing illumination in homes, businesses, and various other settings. They come in various types to suit different needs and preferences. Here are some common types of light bulbs:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Incandescent Bulbs</h3>
                    <p>Incandescent bulbs produce light by heating a filament wire until it glows. While they provide warm, soft light, they are not energy-efficient and have a shorter lifespan compared to other types.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs)</h3>
                    <p>CFLs are energy-saving bulbs that use fluorescent technology to produce light. They are more energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan compared to incandescent bulbs. CFLs are available in various shapes and sizes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs)</h3>
                    <p>LEDs are highly energy-efficient and have an exceptionally long lifespan. They are versatile and come in various colors, making them suitable for various applications, including residential, commercial, and outdoor lighting.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Halogen Bulbs</h3>
                    <p>Halogen bulbs are a type of incandescent bulb that contains halogen gas. They produce bright, white light and are commonly used in spotlights and task lighting. They offer excellent color rendering.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Fluorescent Tubes</h3>
                    <p>Fluorescent tubes are long, tubular bulbs used for general lighting in commercial and industrial settings. They are energy-efficient but may have a cold start, especially in older models.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Smart Bulbs</h3>
                    <p>Smart bulbs can be controlled remotely using a smartphone or voice commands. They often offer features like color-changing, dimming, and scheduling, l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥l̥allowing users to create customized lighting experiences.</p>
